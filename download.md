## Building from source
Building Csound from source or from the git develop branch is not very difficult on Linux, and can also be done on Mac and Windows. How-to descriptions can be found in the BUILD.md file included with the Csound sources, also available online [here](https://github.com/csound/csound/blob/develop/BUILD.md).
