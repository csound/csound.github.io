# Download

You will find the current version of Csound in [http://sourceforge.net/projects/csound/files/csound6/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/csound/files/csound6/). In the folder with the most recent version number you will find different files:

* For **Apple** Macintosh, disk image files (.dmg). Choose the version which fits to your OSX version. If there is none, choose the next below (for instance choose 10.8 if you have 10.9 but there is none).
* For **Windows**, choose the file ending in .exe.
* For **Linux**, use the sources as .zip or .tar.gz . You can also get Csound from the repository of your distribution, but probably you will not find there the most recent version. If you have some experience in building from source, you should consider this (see below for instructions).
* For **Android**, use the .apk file for a Csound executable. The csound-android.zip contains the sources - you only need it when you develop own Android Csound applications.
* For **iOS** development, use csound-iOS.zip.
* For using Csound inside **Max**, you will find the csound~ external as .zip or .pkg.
* The Csound **Manual** comes in different formats in the "manual" folder. Choose the one you need. You should also find an up-to-date version online at www.csounds.com/manual.

Some more detailed download instructions can be found in the [Csound FLOSS Manual](http://en.flossmanuals.net/a-make-csound-run).

Building Csound from source or from the git develop branch is not very difficult on Linux, and can also be done on Mac and Windows. How-to descriptions can be found in the BUILD.md file included with the Csound sources, also available online [here](https://github.com/csound/csound/blob/develop/BUILD.md).
