# About

Csound is a sound and music computing system which has originally been developed by Barry Vercoe in 1985 at MIT Media Lab. Since the 90s, it is developed by a group of core developers, and a wider community of volunteers which contribute examples, documentation, articles, and takes part of the Csound development by bug reports, feature requests and discussions with the core development team.

Although Csound has a strong tradition as a tool for composing electro-acoustic pieces, it is used by composers and musicians for probably any kind of music which can be made with the help of the computer. Many people use Csound in real-time contextes, more and more on mobile devices or in combination with other programming languages.

One of the main principles in Csound development is to guarantee backwards compatibility. You can today still render a Csound source file from 1986, and you shall be able to render a file from now with the Csound of 2036.
