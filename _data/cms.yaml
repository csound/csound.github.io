# SIDE BANNER 
# Normally we have a list of latest news on the main page to the right
# of the 'About Csound' text. If we have something special to announce
# (like a conference), we can put the special info into this block. The info
# should contain a title, a description text (Markdown will work) and an image.
# If the field 'published' == 1, then this info will be displayed,
# if 'published' == 0, the latest news will be displayed.
#
# NB: You may want to keep an unpublished material as an example for the future.
