		  <dd>
		  The paper presents a detailed review on the pch2csd application,
		  developed for conversion of popular Clavia Nord Modular G2
		  synthesizer patch format pch2 into a Csound-based metalanguage.
		  The Nord Modular G2 was one of the most remarkable synthesizers
		  of late 90s. A considerable number of different patches makes
		  Nord Modular G2 to be a desirable target for software emulation.
		  In this paper we describe the pch2csd work flow, including
		  modeling approach, so the developer may use the paper as a
		  starting point for further experiments. Each model of Nord
		  Modular's unit is implemented as an User-defined Opcode. The
		  paper gives an approach for modeling, including description of
		  ancillary files needed for the correct work. First presented at
		  the International Csound Conference 2015 in St. Petersburg, the
		  pch2csd project continues to develop. Some directions for future
		  developments and strategic plans are suggested. The example of
		  transformation of Nord Modular G2 patch into the Csound code
		  concludes the paper.

	Rehearsing and Performing Mixed Media Music</p>
      <p class="author">Guillermo Senna and Juan Nava Aroza <span class="pdf"><a href="./proceedings/ICSC2017_paper_Senna.pdf"><img src="./img/iconpdf.svg" alt="pdf"></a></span></p>

		  <dt>Abstract</dt>
		  <dd>
		  In this paper we present a new modular software framework for
		  composing, rehearsing and performing mixed media music. By
		  combining and extending existing open-source software we were
		  able to synchronize the playback of the free Musescore music
		  notation editor with three VST audio effects exported using the
		  Csound frontend Cabbage. The JACK Audio Connection Kit sound
		  server was used to provide a common clock and a shared virtual
		  timeline to which each component could adhere to and follow.
		  Moreover, data contained on the musical score was used to control
		  the relative position of specific Csound events within the
		  aforementioned timeline. We will explain the nature of the
		  plugins that were built and briefly identify the five new Csound
		  opcodes that the development process required. We will also
		  comment on a generic programming pattern that could be used to
		  create new compatible VST audio effects and instruments. Finally,
		  we will conclude by mentioning what other related software exists
		  that can interact out-of-the-box with our framework, how
		  instrument players and computer performers can simulate the
		  performance experience while practicing their corresponding parts
		  at home and what our future plans for this software ecosystem
		  are.

		  This paper will cover the features of the Emacs package
		  csound-mode, a new major&ndash;mode for coding with Csound. The
		  package is in most part a typical emacs major mode where
		  indentation rules, completions, docstrings and syntax
		  highlighting are provided. With an extra feature of a REPL, that
		  is based on running csound instance through the csound&ndash;api.
		  Similar to csound&ndash;repl.vim csound&ndash;mode strives to enable the
		  Csound user a faster feedback loop by offering a REPL instance
		  inside of a text editor. Making the gap between development and
		  the final output reachable within a realtime interaction.

		  <dt>Abstract</dt>

		  Vim is a powerful, free, cross-platform text editor, very popular
		  among programmers and developers. Luis Jure's csound-vim plugin
		  provides a set of tools for editing Csound files with Vim, like
		  syntax recognition and highlighting, folding, autocompletion,
		  on-line reference, and templates, as well as macros for compiling
		  Csound orchestras from within Vim. Steven Yi's csound-repl plugin
		  provide functionalities to live code with Csound. In this talk,
		  we will demonstrate the features found in each of these plugins
		  and discuss workflows for Vim and Csound.

		  <dt>Abstract</dt>
		  <dd>
		  A new concept for generating non&ndash;isochronous musical metres is
		  introduced, which produces complete rhythmic sequences on the
		  basis of integer partitions and combinatorics. It was realized as
		  a command&ndash;line tool called chunking, written in C++ and
		  published under the GPL licence. Chunking produces scores for
		  Csound as well as standard notation output using Lilypond. A new
		  shorthand notation for rhythm is presented as intermediate data
		  that can be sent to different backends.The algorithm uses a
		  musical hierarchy of sentences, phrases, patterns and rhythmic
		  chunks. The design of the algorithms was influenced by recent
		  studies in music phenomenology, and makes references to
		  psychology and cognition as well.

		  <dt>Abstract</dt>
		  <dd>
		  This work presents ongoing research based on the design of an
		  environment for Spatial Synthesis of Sound using Csound through
		  granular synthesis, spectral data based synthesis and 3D
		  spatialisation. Spatial Synthesis of Sound may be conceived as a
		  particular way of sonic production in which the composer
		  generates the sound together with its spatial features. Though
		  this type of conception lives in the mind and work of most
		  composers (specially in electroacoustic music) from many time
		  ago, some strategies applied were inspired on the work of Gary
		  Kendall. Kendall makes specific mention of both Granular
		  Synthesis and Spectral data based synthesis as examples of
		  resources through which the composer may partition the sonic
		  stream in both the time domain and the frequency domain,
		  respectively. These procedures allow a detailed spatial treatment
		  of each one of the obtained parts of a sound which, in turn, may
		  lead to realistic or unusual spatial images. The aim is not to
		  describe in detail granular synthesis, nor spectral data based
		  synthesis neither sound spatialisation techniques, but to
		  describe the particular strategies in the design for the
		  aforementioned purposes.

		  This talk is a report of an ongoing project aiming to develop a
		  series of opcodes providing an integral solution for sound
		  spatialization in Csound, using
		  state&ndash;of&ndash;the&ndash;art techniques. The specific
		  goals include extending and improving the present Ambisonics
		  opcodes, developing a configurable high quality 3D Ambisonics FDN
		  reverberator, and an opcode for sound localization with
		  Ambisonics plus distance.
