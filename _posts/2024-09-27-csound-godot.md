Werner Mendizabal has successfully integrated Csound with the Godot game engine, now supporting all platforms that Godot targets: Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, and Web.

To showcase this, look at an example projectâ€”a music synthesizer in Godot based on amsynth. You can explore the web-based version of the project here:
