Release notes are available on the Github download page:

This release contains a number of bug fixes and changes, particularly
around working with automations.  Many thanks to Menno for his
suggestions, feedback, and testing assistance for this release.

For upcoming releases, 2.7.5 will take care of a few things that
didn't make it into 2.7.4. 2.8.0 is planned to deal with migrating to
Java 11 and moving to Maven for the build system. Beyond that there
are number of other features planned that require some evaluation for
scheduling. Issues and planning can be viewed at the Github issues
tracker for Blue.

All best,
Steven
