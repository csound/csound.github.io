The Csound developers have migrated Csound from Sourceforge.  The main organization page for Csound is available at [http://github.com/csound](http://github.com/csound). We have moved the following git repositories:

* [Csound6](http://github.com/csound/csound)
* [Manual](http://github.com/csound/manual) 
* [Manual (French)](http://github.com/csound/manual-fr)

We have also migrated the issue tracker for csound to [http://github.com/csound/csound/issues](http://github.com/csound/csound/issues), and the Wiki to [http://github.com/csound/csound/wiki](http://github.com/csound/csound/wiki). 

Note: At this time, we will continue to use the Sourceforge project page for maintaining the mailing lists as well as file releases.

We hope that moving to Github will make things easier for the Csound community to contribute back to Csound.
