There's a wonderful interview with Dr. Boulanger and video of his work, [Symphonic Muse](https://vimeo.com/121197394), available online at the [LeapMotion Blog](http://blog.leapmotion.com/fingerpainting-soundscapes-muse-leap-motion-berklee-symphony-orchestra/).  The piece uses the wonderful [Muse](https://apps.leapmotion.com/apps/muse) for Leap Motion application, powered by Csound. Bravo Dr. B, a beautiful work and inspiring read!
