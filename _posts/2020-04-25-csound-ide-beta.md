The beta release of the Csound Web-IDE is now available at:

<https://ide.csound.com/>

The Web-IDE is an integrated development environment for Csound.  Projects work as they would on the Desktop in terms of files, resources, and project structure.  The IDE runs on major browsers, including ChromeOS on Chromebooks, and has everything required to create, run, and share Csound projects, no installation necessary.

The IDE is the work of Hlöðver Sigurðsson, Edward Costello, and Steven Yi.
