Blue 2.6.1 is now available at:

[https://github.com/kunstmusik/blue/releases/tag/2.6.1](https://github.com/kunstmusik/blue/releases/tag/2.6.1)


Release notes are available at that link describing the changes in
detail.  The big changes are improvements to automation editing and
improved support for Clojure. For the latter, projects can now define
library dependencies using library coordinates and versions, which are
automatically downloaded and entered into the project namespace (uses
Chas Emerick's pomegranate).  Also, a Clojure REPL is available for
testing out code.

The next release will be 2.7.0 (tracked at
[https://github.com/kunstmusik/blue/milestone/15](https://github.com/kunstmusik/blue/milestone/15)).  2.6.x releases will
be made if any major bugs are found.

Special thanks to Menno for testing out the 2.6.1 test releases and
for all of the great feature requests!

Thanks and enjoy!

Steven
