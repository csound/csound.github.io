Francois Pinot has reported on the Csound users mailing list of a new Csound API binding in the Go programming language, as well as a Go version of Andre Bartetzki's Cmask entitled Gmask. His original post is below. 

Hello,

I've been playing with the Google Go programming language [http://golang.org/](http://golang.org/) during the last few months. I really like this new programming language and I tried to use it with Csound.

I wrote go bindings to the Csound API [(https://github.com/fggp/go-csnd6)](https://github.com/fggp/go-csnd6) and I adapted Steven's API examples to go: [https://github.com/csound/csoundAPI_examples/tree/master/go
](https://github.com/csound/csoundAPI_examples/tree/master/go)

I also wrote a go version of Andre Bartetzki's Cmask program: [https://github.com/fggp/gmask](https://github.com/fggp/gmask). Cmask was published under GPL, but Andre kindly allowed me to publish Gmask under LGPL to be more compatible with the Csound status. Thanks to Andre.

If some csounders/programmers are interested in those packages, I'd be glad to see their use of them.

Regards


Francois
