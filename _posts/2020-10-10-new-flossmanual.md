[Release note](https://flossmanual.csound.com/introduction/on-this-release)

All examples can now be executed directly in a web browser (preferably Chrome/Chromium), without any previous installation of Csound. Hlöðver Sigurðsson has written the complete environment, including a new version of the Csound WASM module. It is also possible to edit the code in the browser, and execute again.
