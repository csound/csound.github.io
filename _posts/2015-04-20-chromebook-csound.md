A Chrome App for editing and playing csd files o Chromebook.

You can also run it on any desktop environment with Google Chrome
installed.

The code is at [https://github.com/fcahoon/CsoundForChromebook] (https://github.com/fcahoon/CsoundForChromebook) .

It is not yet packaged as a Chrome app; I recommend running it from
inside of Google's Chrome Dev Editor, which can be downloaded from
[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrome-dev-editor-develop/pnoffddplpippgcfjdhbmhkofpnaalpg]
