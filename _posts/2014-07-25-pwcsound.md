[Giorgio Zucco](http://pwcsound.jimdo.com/bio/) reports that his [PWCsound 0.5 Beta](http://pwcsound.jimdo.com) is now available on Mac OSX (with Windows coming soon).  From the site:

> PWCsound is a graphical Pwgl library interface for building csound instruments by patching modules similar to modular synthesizers. This library has been motivated by the need to form a bridge between various composition tools found in [Pwgl](http://www2.siba.fi/PWGL) and Csound programming language.
> 
> The musician can generate a .csd csound file visually by choosing a set of boxes and making connections between them. 
> 
> It's intended for Csound beginners to learn some fundamentals about this wonderful language and for advanced Csound users, who want to test their ideas and play with input parameters in a graphical user interface, to generate complex and multi-layered musical textures.
