The [Csound FLOSS Manual](https://flossmanual.csound.com/) has a new release (8.1) which includes these novelties:

- Csound 7 (beta) is now under the hook, so you can try out any Csound 7 code.  
- There is a [chapter](https://flossmanual.csound.com/basics/csound7) in the appendix which explains some of the new features in Csound 7.  
- There is a french translation now, thanks to Xavier Dole, mostly containing the *Getting Started*. The direct link to the first chapter is [here](https://flossmanual.csound.com/fr/premiers-pas/gs-01).

Enjoy!
