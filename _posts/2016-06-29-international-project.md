A new international collaboration project, based at the NTNU in
Trondheim, Norway, and funded by the Norwegian Academy of Sciences,
has been launched: "Cross adaptive processing as musical intervention:
exploring radically new modes of musical interaction in live performance."

The project explores cross-adaptive processing as a drastic
intervention in the modes of communication between performing
musicians. Digital audio analysis and processing techniques are used
to enable features of one sound to inform the processing of another.
This allows the actions of one performer to directly influence another
performerâ€™s sound, and doing so only by means of the acoustic signal
produced by normal musical expression on the instrument.

Csound is used in the analysis of audio features and in the control
signal mapping. New Csound opcodes for signal analysis are developed
as part of the project. Cabbage is used to wrap the Csound instruments
as VST, to enable the techniques to be used in the workflow of any
standard DAW

A blog with lots of interesting information on the project is found
