We are pleased to announce that to mark the 30th birthday of Csound we will be holding two days of music, discussion and 
Guiness at the National University of Ireland at Maynooth from the 25th to the 26th of November 2016. We are keen to receive 
proposals for pieces and papers for this conference and further details will be published shortly but in the meantime, 
feel free to write to any of us informally or contact us through the [Csound mailing list](http://csound.github.io/community.html) with questions or suggestions. 

We look forward to seeing you in November!


Brian, Iain, Rory and Victor
