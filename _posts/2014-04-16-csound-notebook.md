The new Csound Notebook server is now available online at:

* [http://csound-notebook.kunstmusik.com](http://csound-notebook.kunstmusik.com)

This site allows for users to create notebooks and organize Csound notes online. It allows you to render your Csound notes without having Csound installed. Instead, the site will render your project using Portable Native Client (pNaCl) Csound, which requires using Google Chrome, Chromium, or Chrome OS. This if the first release of the Notebook server, with many more new features to come. Enjoy!
