_Hector Centeno has announced the release of [AmbiExplorer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.hcenteno.ambiexplorer), an Ambisonics file player
for Android:_

Hello,

I just would like to share that I've been working on an app currently
available in the Google Play store named AmbiExplorer. It allows you to
listen to ambisonic B-Format recordings decoded as binaural stereo and
stereo virtual microphones. It can do head-tracking using the internal
sensors of the device or an external bluetooth tracker (BT connectivity
available in the upcoming version 2). It uses Csound as the audio engine.

I didn't share the news here before because I was considering using Csound
only for prototyping and later building my own sound DSP engine but for now
I've decided to stick with Csound, mainly for practical reasons and because
I'm interested in contributing to the development of Android Csound.

Version 2 will include library handling (with option to import files from
online libraries), geotagging, map view, location based playback and
selection of HRTF from the LISTEN library.
