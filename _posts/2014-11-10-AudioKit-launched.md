Aurelius Prochazka has announced the launch of AudioKit:

"Hi everyone,

I'm happy to announce that the Csound project that I've been working on for the last couple of years has finally been open-sourced.   The project is the result of collaboration between Adam Boulanger and myself (and most recently Nick Arner); it's called AudioKit and it is basically a way to write audio applications entirely in Objective-C or Swift, using Csound as the sound engine, but not writing any orchestra or score files directly. Here's the web site:

[http://audiokit.io/] (http://audiokit.io/)

If it looks like your cup of tea, give it a shot and let me know if you have any issues.  I'm making myself personally accessible to Csounders who want to try out AudioKit for help with implementation, bugs,  and any feature requests at this early stage. 

Thanks,
Aure"
