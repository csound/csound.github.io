Csound 6.09.1 has been released!

[https://github.com/csound/csound/releases/tag/6.09.1](https://github.com/csound/csound/releases/tag/6.09.1)

[https://github.com/csound/csound/blob/develop/Release_Notes/Version_6.09.md](Full Changelog)

This is mostly a bugfix release of version 6.09 addressing a number of
issues, including a bug in multicore performance. The Web Assembly
platform is introduced in this release, as well as support for Swift
development on iOS. Some DLLs that were missing from the Windows
installer also have been added to it. Following Google's deprecation
of PNaCl, this platform has been dropped from the release and will not
be further developed.
