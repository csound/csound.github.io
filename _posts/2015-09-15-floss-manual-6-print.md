The 6th Csound FLOSS Manual is now available as a book. The text is already available [online](http://floss.booktype.pro/csound/preface/), but a paper book can provide a fresh perspective.

This huge and heavy book can be purchased online at Lulu: [click here](http://www.lulu.com/shop/joachim-heintz-and-iain-mccurdy/csound-floss-manual/paperback/product-22359512.html)

The goal of this manual is to provide an easy-to-read introduction to Csound. It is intended as an introduction-tutorial-reference hybrid, gathering together the most important information you will need for working with Csound in a variety of situations.
