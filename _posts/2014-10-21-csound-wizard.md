*Anton Kholomiov has reported the release of a new Android application for playing Csound projects, using JSON to define interfaces.  His original email is below.*

Dear list,

I'd like to announce an Android player for Csound files. It's a piece
of magic. What can it do:

* Clean and minimalistic design
* The UI's are configured with JSON. 
* There are many-many widgets (knobs, buttons, multitouch, radio groups etc).
* The user can create and manage playlists
* the state of the widgets is persisted
* Bugs. It's a first release.

The code is getting twisted. I can no longer keep it in one head. 
So I'm asking for a help with development and maintainence.
