It's been many years in the making, but Cabbage v1.0 is finally available to the public. Cabbage is a framework for developing audio software that harnesses the DSP power of Csound. With a single source file users can target desktop, mobile, and plugins formats across a range of platforms. It ships with over 100 sample instruments ranging from simple synths to complex spectral streaming audio effects, and comes with a simple patching environment for testing and prototyping effects. You can find out more about it here over at the Cabbage homepage.
