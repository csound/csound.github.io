[Soundpipe](http://www.github.com/PaulBatchelor/Soundpipe.git) is an embeddable 
music DSP library written in C. It is aimed at composers, programmers,  and
creative coders who need high quality sounds in their applications. Internally, 
many of the modules currently in Soundpipe are direct ports from Csound opcodes.
