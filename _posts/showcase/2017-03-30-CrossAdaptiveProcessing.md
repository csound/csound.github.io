Csound is used as a central part of research on improvised electroacoustic music performance centered at NTNU, Trondheim Norway. Using Csound-based custom effect processing routines (including Hadron, Liveconvolver and others), new methods of making music is developed and investigated. A project on live processing (2011-2014) of improvised performance resulted in the creation of a dedicated ensemble (T-EMP) and is documented at [https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/48123/48124/10/10](https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/48123/48124/10/10), with an album release at [http://www.cdbaby.com/Artist/TEmpTrondheimElectroacousticMu](http://www.cdbaby.com/Artist/TEmpTrondheimElectroacousticMu)

A project on crossadaptive effect processing as musical intervention is running from 2016 to 2018, involving several key members of the Csound community (Oeyvind Brandtsegg, Sigurd Saue, Victor Lazzarini, Rory Walsh, Bernt Isak Wærstad, Andreas Bergsland), and other prominent partners.
