Soundpipe is a highly portable and lightweight music DSP library written in C. While not directly using Csound, Soundpipe uses many algorithms adapted from the Csound source code. Soundpipe is suited for a wide array of platforms, and versions have been compiled on Linux, Raspberry Pi, iOS, Android, and the STM32F4 discovery board. It is also the main audio synthesis engine for the iOS framework [AudioKit](http://audiokit.io/), as well as the stack-based audio language [Sporth](https://paulbatchelor.github.io/proj/sporth.html)
