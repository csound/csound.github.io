The sound installation “VLBI Music” was made as an art piece for the Norwegian Mapping authority’s headquarters in Hønefoss. The composition is based on measurements of distant quasars, done by the mapping authority in collaboration with other scientific institutions worldwide. The purpose of the measurements is to create a stable reference for other positioning services. The sound installation uses the processes of of the VLBI (Verly Long Baseline Interferometry) system as well as the raw data as material for the live running composition. Csound is used both for sound synthesis and compositional algorithms, interfaced to Python for some of data processing from the measurements. 

The live audio stream can be heard at [http://193.90.68.207:8000/stream/1/](http://193.90.68.207:8000/stream/1/) and there is an app for Android also relaying the audio stream.
