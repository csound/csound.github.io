Cabbage is a framework for audio software development. Using Csound as its audio engine, Cabbage users can target Windows, OSX, Linux and Android with a single piece of source code. As well as developing standalone software, users can also export their instruments as fully functional audio plugins, thus paving the way for full integration of Csound into any number of digital audio workstations.
