Traditionally, convolution has only been possible on a static (previously stored and analyzed) impulse response. With Liveconvolver4, Oeyvind Brandtsegg and Sigurd Saue have developed a method to convolve two live sources with each other. The impulse response is updated and replaced one partition at a time, in a synchronized manner, allowing for updates to the IR without introducing audio clicks or glitches. This method also allows for parametric processing of the IR while it is actively used for convolution. This work becomes available in Csound 6.09.
