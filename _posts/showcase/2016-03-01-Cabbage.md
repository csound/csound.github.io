Cabbage is a framework for audio software development. Using Csound as its audio engine, Cabbage users can target Windows, OSX, Linux and Android with a single piece of source code. As well as developing standalone software, users can also export their instruments as fully functional audio plugins, thus paving the way for full integration of Csound into any number of digital audio workstations.

Cabbage has a dedicated user forum and website that can be accessed [here](http://cabbageaudio.com). Note that Cabbage also provide a dedciated forum for Csound beginners, as well as threads on all other aspects of using, building, and tweaking the software.
