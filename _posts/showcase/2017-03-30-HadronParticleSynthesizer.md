The Hadron Particle Synthesizer is a synth, sampler and effects processor based on the partikkel plugin. The interface has been designed with live performance in mind, providing rich access to the underlying 200+ synthesis parameters via simple user controls. The main parts of Hadron was developed during 2008 to 2011 by Oeyvind Brandtsegg, in collaboration with Arne Skeie (graphic design), Bernt Isak WÃ¦rstad (M4L and VST interface) and Sigurd Saue (VST interface).
