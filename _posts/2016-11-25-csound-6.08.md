Csound 6.08 has been released!

[https://github.com/csound/csound/releases/tag/6.08.0](https://github.com/csound/csound/releases/tag/6.08.0)


As usual there are a number of opcode fixes and improvements, but the
major changes are in the language structures. First the score language
has all-new treatment of macros and preprocessing, bringing it in line
with those of the orchestra. The parsing of the orchestra has had a
number of fixes as outlined below.

A major, and not totally compatible change as been made in reading and
writing array elements. The rate of the index now often determines
the time of processing; check the entry below under Orchestra. This
simplifies much code and seems to capture expectations; the earlier ad
hoc code had many anomalies.

Also as usual there are a number of new opcodes and internal fixes
to memory leaks and more robust code.
