Csound has now syntax highlighting in Eclipse:

"Hey guys,

We have finished a syntax-highlighting-file for Csound in Eclipse.
You can find the files and all information on her webblog:
[http://hollyhook.de/wp/syntax-highlighting-of-csound-files-in-eclipse] (http://hollyhook.de/wp/syntax-highlighting-of-csound-files-in-eclipse)

We just wanted to let you know, so this will hopefully find an 
introduction into the Csound-community!

Cheers, Lisa
