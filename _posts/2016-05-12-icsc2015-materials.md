On 2â€“4 October 2015 members of the Csound community gathered together for the
3rd&nbsp;International Csound Conference, held in St. Petersburg State University
of&nbsp;Telecommunications (Russia). The conference was organized by Dr. Gleb G.
Rogozinsky together with Eugene Cherny, Alex Glazkov, Dr. Lidia Ader and many
other people helping with all kinds of organizational activities.

During the three days of the conference we grasped the details of the Csound 7,
discussed the language's future at the user-developer round table and learned
about cutting edge uses of the Csound for interactive installations
