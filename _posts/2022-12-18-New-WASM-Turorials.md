Victor Lazzarini has published a [Vanilla Guide to Webaudio Csound](https://vlazzarini.github.io/vanilla/) which include a bunch of inspiring tutorials. 
Amongst them are examples showing the interaction between Javascript Csound and p5.js (the javascript version of [Processing](https://processing.org/).
More to come ...
