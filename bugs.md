Csound consists of different parts. Depending on the subject, your bug report should go to one of these different addresses.

### A bug on this site (csound.com)

*Example: You click on a link and get to a "page not found" error.*

Please report the bug on [tis site's issue tracker](https://github.com/csound/csound.github.io/issues).

In case you are not familiar with Github, you can also write an email to *website* at *cs-conf.de*.


### A bug in the Csound core

*Example: Opcode XYZ outputs 0 when I set the third input argument to 1 although the [Reference Manual](https://csound.com/docs/manual/index.html) states this should output -1.*

Please file what you consider to be a bug to the [Csound issue tracker](https://github.com/csound/csound/issues). Please describe in the bug report:  
- which Csound code do you run (include a code which is as minimal as possible)
- whether you run Csound from command line or from any frontend
- which version of Csound do you use
- what is your operating system


### A bug in one of the Frontends and Interfaces

*Example: Edit > Copy in CsoundQt for Windows is not working.*  
*Or: Cabbage always pops up with lettuces in the GUI panel.*
