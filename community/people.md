How do people use Csound? What does the Csound language offer composers other synthesizer programs lack (in their opinion) ? 
Look at these videos where Csound People share their thoughts on these and other Csound related subjects and find out how Csound adds to their musical life.

**First Encounters** - Susan, Bethanie, Sam, and Strong Bear have been introduced to and started exploring and creating with Csound. Susan and Bethanie have extensive classical training on piano and recorder, while Strong Bear and Sam are jazz and commercial players, arrangers, and composers. They all want to expand their horizons by using Csound in their latest electroacoustic works, algorithmic jam sessions, app development, and game audio projects. Csound opens doors, expands their horizons, and helps them gain more clarity and understanding as it lights the way to new sounds, new virtual ensembles, new game ideas, and new forms of interactive musical expression and performance.

**Dave Seidel** - Dave makes use of Csound's indifference to the Western tuning system of 12 notes in an octave. Long tones interweave together, or make a beating sound; it is a dance of tone colors. By using longer tones in the composition, Dave moves the listener to a trance-like state, and invites the listerner to join the dance.

**Michael Gogins**  -   Michael has, over the years, developed his own agorithmic music sytem CsoundAC. One of the options of CsoundAC is applying of fractals or other mathematic formulas to generate scores. He posseses a nice collection of Csound instruments and other midi instruments. Csound is used to render the generated scores.

**John ffitch** -   John sees beauty in algebra. As a mathematician, John is interested in repeating score patterns as created by dynamic systems such as the Henon system. Such systems exhibit some chaotic behavior, and thus, when applied to musical patterns, result in interesting music.
