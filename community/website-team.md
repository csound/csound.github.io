This website is maintained by a group of Csounders from all over the world.

We try to offer information and orientation for both, people who are new to Csound, and people who already use Csound.

If you have ideas about improvements, please open a ticket on the [discussions page](https://github.com/csound/csound.github.io/discussions). 

If you found bugs or mistakes, please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/csound/csound.github.io/issues).

If you want to join us, write an email to *website* at *cs-conf.de*!

Thanks for your contributions!
