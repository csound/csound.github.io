# Frontends

Csound comes without any interface. If you do not want to use Csound via the Terminal or the API, you will need a "frontend". Currently, three frontends are available:

**CsoundQt** (http://sourceforge.net/projects/qutecsound/) is most probably already included in the Mac and Windows installer. It has nice tools for editing Csound files, comes with easy editable widgets and a huge example collection.

**Cabbage** (http://www.thecabbagefoundation.org is originally designed to create VST plugins from Csound instruments, but it can also be used to run and edit Csound files, as well as creating standalone applications.

**Blue** (http://sourceforge.net/projects/bluemusic/) is a huge composition tool for working with Csound.

**WinXound** (winxound.codeplex.com) is still a great frontend to work with Csound, in particular for Windows.

**RIBCsound** (rorywalsh.github.io/RIBCsound) is an online (Chrome only) interface builder for generating Csound enabled web-pages. Csound channels can be set up between widgets and instruments so that end-users can control the Csound instruments in real-time in the browser.
