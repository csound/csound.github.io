## What is Csound?

Csound is a complete software package for making computer music. Csound offers the opportunity to produce 
different sounds, such as a simple sine wave, a complex sprectrum, noise, or to work with sampled sounds.
We write Csound code which is then compiled. When we run it, it creates a stream of numbers
representing audio. In order for us to hear that audio we must send it to our sound card. 
The Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) converts the stream of numbers to a varying voltage that causes our
speakers to move and vibrate, thus creating sound.

## Csound Editors
Csound text can be written using any source code editor. After a decade in which Csound shipped 
with CsoundQt as default IDE, starting from Csound 6.15, no third-party graphic frontends are shipped 
with the installation packages on MacOs and Windows. Users should install their choice of frontend separately. 
The following is a list of editors and extensions written specifically for editing Csound files (.csd).

and is a convenient, installation-free, cross-platform way of working with Csound. 

## Csound syntax

All Csound code is case sensitive. That means upper-case letters are not the same as lower-case letters. Presented below is the typical document structure for a single unified Csound file.
All Csound source code is made up of several sections which are defined in [XML](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/) type tags. The most
important sections are the **CsInstruments** and **CsScore** sections. Simply put, **CsInstruments** defines how our instruments will sound,
while **CsScore** defines when and how long they will sound. Presented below is the typical document
structures for a single unified Csound file.

<pre><code data-language="csound">
&lt;CsoundSynthesizer&gt;
;all code relating to Csound should be encapsulated between 
;&lt;CsoundSynthesizer&gt; and &lt;/CsoundSynthesizer&gt;
&lt;CsOptions&gt;
;this section tells Csound how to interact with various devices and hardware
&lt;/CsOptions&gt;
&lt;CsInstruments&gt;
;this section contains instrument definitions
&lt;/CsInstruments&gt;  
&lt;CsScore&gt;
;this section tells Csound when and how to perform instruments defined
;in the CsInstruments section above. 
&lt;/CsScore&gt;
&lt;/CsoundSynthesizer&gt;
</code></pre>

Csound code can be described in terms of its syntax and grammar. Each section uses a slightly
different syntax. For instance, the syntax used to define an instrument in *CsInstruments* is not the same as the
simplified syntax used in the *CsScore* section. We will begin by introducing the *CsInstruments* syntax, 
which is made up of 6 different components: keywords, variables,
constants, opcodes, operators and comments.

### Instrument code

#### Keywords

Keywords are special reserved words that have a unique function and meaning. The two most commonly
used keywords in the Csound language are **instr** and **endin**. These two keywords define an
instrument block which contains instructions on how an instrument functions. Each instrument must be
given a unique name or number which follows the **instr** keyword.

<pre><code data-language="csound">
instr 1
;do stuff
endin

instr DoStuff
;do stuff
endin
</code></pre>


#### Constants

System constants are found in the CsInstruments *header section*. The *header section* appears
before any instrument block and sets up vital information about things such as sampling rates,
**sr**, the number of audio channels to use, **nchnls**, and decibels relative to full scale,
**0dbfs**.

<pre><code data-language="csound">
sr = 44100
nchnls = 2
0dbfs = 1

instr 1
;to stuff
endin
</code></pre>

#### Variables

Constants are easy to spot in Csound code. They appear as fixed numbers. Their values cannot change
at any stage during performance, or between performances. Variables on the other hand are temporary
memory slots that can be used to store data. The three simplest and most common types of variables
in Csound are **i**, **k** and **a**-rate variables. These types of variables are very easy to spot
in Csound because they will always begin with an i, k or a.

<pre><code data-language="csound">
instr 1
iAmp = 1
kFreq = 440
aSignal = 0
endin
</code></pre>

Variables can be given any name so long as they start with an i, k or a. So what do the i, k and a
mean?

When Csound calls an instrument, it begins looping very quickly through its code. **i-rate** variables are set
**before the very first loop**, which is called the **initialization pass**. We cannot easily change their value afterwards.
**k-rate** and **a-rate** variables, however, can be changed (and usually are) every loop. The crucial difference is that
**k-rate** variables contain a single number, whilst **a-rate** variables contain what we call an **audio vector**. 

A more in depth explanation of these different variable types can be found in the [Csound FLOSS Manual](https://flossmanual.csound.com/csound-language/initialization-and-performance-pass). 

Csound also has other types of variables such as 
[Strings](https://flossmanual.csound.com/csound-language/local-and-global-variables#variable-types) and 
[Arrays](https://flossmanual.csound.com/csound-language/arrays).
However for the moment, we only need the variable types already described to continue this tutorial.


#### Opcodes

Opcodes do things. They are the brains of each and every Csound instrument. What they do is usually
described by their name. **reverb** for example applies a reverb to an audio signal while **random**
generates random numbers. Opcodes, like variables can be **a**, **k**, or **i**-rate.

In their most common form, opcodes are given input arguments and they output a result. The rate at which
an opcode operates is determined by the output variable name. Outputs always appear to the left of
an opcode name, while inputs always appear to the right of the opcode name. The typical syntax for
most opcodes in Csound is given as

<pre><code data-language="csound">
aOutput opcode input1, input2, input3, ...
</code></pre>

While most opcodes in Csound have outputs as well as inputs, some opcodes only have inputs, while
others only have outputs. It should also be noted that not every opcode can operate at a, k and i
rate. The simplest way to see what rates are supported by what opcode is by looking at the Csound
reference manual.

Lines of opcodes can be connected to create a signal graph which describes the flow of the signal
from one place to another. We can see in the next code example how the signal generated by myOpcode1
is being fed into the input of myOpcode2, which is in turn sent to the inputs of myOpode3. Remember
that the result of each opcode's calculations are passed to its output parameter, which is located
to the left of the opcode. These variables can then be used anywhere else in the instrument block.

<pre><code data-language="csound">
instr 1
a1 myOpcode1 
a2 myOpcode2 a1
a3 myOpcode3 a2
endin
</code></pre>

Csound features more than 1500 opcodes, making it one of the world's most extensive audio programming
languages.

#### Operators

Mathematical operators are essential to all programming languages. Csound is no different. Any
**a**, **k** or **i** rate variable can be operated on using the standard set of mathematical
operators, *, /, +, -, etc. Note that multiplying a variable by 20 does not alter the variable's
value. It simply returns a new value. This new value can then be assigned for use later.

<pre><code data-language="csound">
kVal1 = 100
kVal2 = kVal1*100
</code></pre>

#### Comments

Single line comments can be added using **;** or **//**. Multi-line comments are added using
**/*** to start the comment, and **\*/** to end it.

#### Conditions

If needed one can use specific conditions in order to control a statement or the flow in an instrument 
(or in global space). One can check a variable against another, or against a constant, using a comparison
operator, which can be *true* or *false* as a result.

*a < b*: true if a is smaller than b\
*a <= b*: true if a is smaller than or equal to b\
*a > b*: true if a is bigger than b\
*a >= b*: true if a is bigger than or equal to b\
*a == b*: true if a is equal to b\
*a != b*: true if a is not equal to b

In this case a and b can be variables and/or constants.
One can have a condition using logical operators:

*a && b*: true only if a AND b are true, false otherwise\
*a || b*: true only if a OR b is true, false otherwise

In this case a and b are Boolean expressions using comparison or logical operators.

#### if Statement

The Syntax to use the *if* statement is as follows: 

<pre><code data-language="csound">
if (a condition b) then 
  ...code...
[else
  ...code...]
endif
</code></pre>

The code in square brackets is optional.  
In case one wants to determine different results for more than one condition, the syntax is as follows:

<pre><code data-language="csound">
if (a condition b) then
  ...code...
elseif (a condition b) then
  ...code...
elseif (a condition b) then
  ...code...
else
  ...code...
endif
</code></pre>


#### while Statement

When the user wants something to be in a loop, repeated, then the *while* statement is suitable. The syntax is 
as follows:

<pre><code data-language="csound">
while condition do
  ...code...
od
</code></pre>

### Score statements

#### i Statement

With *i Statement* we can call an instrument with a specified time and duration. We define the *i statement* followed by the p-field parameter as follows:  

i  p1  p2  p3  p4  p5  ...

**p1:** the instrument name or number to be called  
**p2:** the starting time of the specified instrument in beats (default bpm is 60)  
**p3:** duration time in beats, usually a positive number. A negative value will initiate a held note (see also [ihold](https://csound.com/docs/manual/ihold.html)). 
A negative value can also be used for 'always on' instruments like reverberation. 
**p4, p5, ... :** parameters whose significance is determined by the instrument.



## Your first synthesiser

Now that the basics of the Csound language have been outlined, it's time to look at creating a
simple instrument. The opcodes used in this simple instrument are [vco2](docs/manual/vco2.html),
[madsr](docs/manual/madsr.html), [moogladder](docs/manual/moogladder.html) and [out](docs/manual/out.html).

The vco2 opcode models a voltage controlled oscillator. It provides users with an effective way of
generating band-limited waveforms and can be the building blocks of many a synthesiser. In simpler terms, 
it produces a particular sound with a determined timbre, amplitude and frequency.
Its syntax, taken from the Csound reference manual, is given as:

<pre><code data-language="csound">
ares vco2 kamp, kcps [, imode] [, kpw] [, kphs] [, inyx]
</code></pre>

Square brackets around an input argument means that argument is optional and can be left out. 
This means that for learning purposes we can write this opcode in a simpler way:

<pre><code data-language="csound">
ares vco2 kamp, kcps
</code></pre>

It outputs an a-rate signal and accepts several different input arguments. **kamp** determines the amplitude of
the signal, while **kcps** sets the frequency of the signal. The default type of waveform created by
a **vco2** is a sawtooth waveform. An x before an input argument indicates that i, k or a-rate variables can be used. 
This is not the case in the vco2 opcode but in 
[vco](docs/manual/vco.html) which has two x-input arguments:

<pre><code data-language="csound">
ares vco xamp, xcps, iwave, kpw
</code></pre>

The simplest instrument that can be written to use a **vco2** is
given below. The **out** opcode is used to output an a-rate signal as audio.

<pre><code data-language="csound">
instr 1
aOut vco2 1, 440
out aOut
endin
</code></pre>

In order to start the above instrument, an i-statement will need to be added to the Csound score
section like so:

<pre><code data-language="csound">
i 1 0 100
</code></pre>

A Csound score isn't all that different to a traditional musical score. In a traditional
score, dots are used to provide information to the musician. In Csound the dots are replaced with
i-statements, or instrument statements. Each i-statement must contain at least 3 so-called p-fields, 
which are separated by spaces.
The first 3 p-fields have a fixed meaning. They always give the instrument name or number, its start
time in seconds, and its duration in seconds. The following i-statement instructs instrument 1 to
start playing after 0 seconds and continue playing for 100 second.

<pre><code data-language="csound">
;p-fields:
; 1 2 3 
i 1 0 100
</code></pre>

One obvious limitation here is that the instrument always plays a frequency of 440. The simplest way
to address this problem is by adding an extra p-field to the i-statement.

<pre><code data-language="csound">
i1 0 100 500
</code></pre>
 
With the new p-field in place, the instrument block can be modified to access that value using a
special i-rate variable named p4. Whenever Csound starts reading through the code, it will replace
all instances of p4 with the value from the i-statement. Here is a full example that will play back
3 notes, all with a unique pitch and starting time.

<pre><code data-language="csound">
&lt;CsOptions&gt;
; uncomment the next line if you want to play through speakers
; -odac
&lt;/CsOptions&gt;
&lt;CsoundSynthesizer&gt;
&lt;CsInstruments&gt;

; the next line sets the volume scale 0-1
; by default this value is 32767
0dbfs = 1

; defines the first instrument
instr 1
; variable for output,  instrument type,  amplitude,  pitch input 
;                                                     as parameter 4 in the score
  aOut                  vco2              1,          p4
; routes the instrument to default output
out aOut
endin

&lt;/CsInstruments&gt;
&lt;CsScore&gt;
; plays three notes in succession
; instrument  time to play at   length to play  frequency to play
  i1          0                 1               100
  i1          1                 1               200
  i1          2                 1               300
&lt;/CsScore&gt;
&lt;/CsoundSynthesizer&gt;
</code></pre>

i-statements may contain a huge number of p-fields and each one can be accessed in the instrument
block using its associated p-field variable. Here is the same instrument, only this time both the
amplitude and pitch are being controlled via the score. Named variables have been added to hold the
values of p4 and p5. While not necessary, it is good to get into a habit of using clear and well
defined variable names in your code.

<pre><code data-language="csound">
&lt;CsoundSynthesizer&gt;
&lt;CsInstruments&gt;

instr 1
iFreq = p4
iAmp = p5
aOut vco2 iAmp, iFreq
out aOut
endin

&lt;/CsInstruments&gt;
&lt;CsScore&gt;
i1 0 1 100 1
i1 1 1 200 .2
i1 2 1 300 .7
&lt;/CsScore&gt;
&lt;/CsoundSynthesizer&gt;
</code></pre>

Another issue in the instrument presented above is that the notes will click each time they sound.
To avoid this, an amplitude envelope should be applied to the output signal. An envelope causes the 
amplitude of a single to change over time to avoid instant jumps which produce undwanted clicking.
The most common envelope used in synthesisers is the ubiquitous ADSR envelope. ADSR stands for Attack, Decay,
Sustain and Release. The attack, decay and release sections are given in seconds as they relate to
time values. The sustain value describes the sustain level which kicks in after the attack and decay
have passed. The note's amplitude will rest at this sustain level until it is released.


![ADSR](/images/ADSR.png)

Csound offers several ADSR envelopes. The one used here is **madsr**, which is a MIDI ready ADSR.
Its syntax is given as:

<pre><code data-language="csound">
kres madsr iatt, idec, islev, irel
</code></pre>

There are several places in the instrument code where the output of this opcode can be used. It
could be applied directly to the first input argument of the **vco2** opcode, or it can be placed in
the line with the **out** opcode. Both are valid approaches.

<pre><code data-language="csound">
&lt;CsoundSynthesizer&gt;
&lt;CsInstruments&gt;

instr 1
iFreq = p4
iAmp = p5
iAtt = 0.1
iDec = 0.4
iSus = 0.6
iRel = 0.7
kEnv madsr iAtt, iDec, iSus, iRel 
aOut vco2 iAmp, iFreq
out aOut*kEnv
endin

&lt;/CsInstruments&gt;
&lt;CsScore&gt;
i1 0 1 100 1
i1 1 1 200 .2
i1 2 1 300 .7
&lt;/CsScore&gt;
&lt;/CsoundSynthesizer&gt;
</code></pre>

ADSR envelopes are often used to control the cut-off frequency of low-pass filters. A low-pass
filter blocks high frequency components of a sound, while letting lower frequencies pass. A popular
low-pass filter found in Csound is the moogladder filter which is modeled on the famous filters
found in Moog synthesisers. Its syntax is given as:

<pre><code data-language="csound">
asig moogladder ain, kcf, kres
</code></pre>

Its first input argument is an a-rate variable. The next two arguments set the filter cut-off
frequency and the amount of resonance to be added to the signal. Both of these can be k-rate
variables, thus allowing them to be changed during the note. Using the output from the **madsr** to
control the filter's cut-off frequency is trivial and can be seen in the next example.

<pre><code data-language="csound">
&lt;CsoundSynthesizer&gt;
&lt;CsInstruments&gt;

instr 1
iFreq = p4
iAmp = p5
iAtt = 0.1
iDec = 0.4
iSus = 0.6
iRel = 0.7
iCutoff = 5000
iRes = .4
kEnv madsr iAtt, iDec, iSus, iRel 
aVco vco2 iAmp, iFreq
aLp moogladder aVco, iCutoff*kEnv, iRes
out aLp*kEnv
endin

&lt;/CsInstruments&gt;
&lt;CsScore&gt;
i1 0 1 100 1
i1 1 1 200 .2
i1 2 1 300 .7
&lt;/CsScore&gt;
&lt;/CsoundSynthesizer&gt;
</code></pre>

### Controlling your instrument with MIDI

While the score section offers lots of versatility when it comes to writing and composing music with
Csound, it can be a little restrictive when it comes to performing live. Many musicians will prefer
to use a MIDI keyboard to trigger notes. Csound offers a very simple way of accessing values from
the MIDI keyboard. But first Csound must be instructed to listen to messages from a MIDI keyboard.
This can be done in the &lt;CsOptions&gt; section of the source code. The &lt;CsOptions&gt; section
is populated with unique flags that tell Csound how to interact with different devices. A **-Ma**
will tell Csound to listen for MIDI messages from all available devices. A **-odac** can also be
added. This will instruct Csound to output audio to the computer's sound card. In order to pass MIDI
note and amplitude data to an instrument, so-called MIDI-interop command line flags can be used.
Consider the following example:

<pre><code data-language="csound">
&lt;CsOptions&gt;
-odac -Ma --midi-key-cps=4 --midi-velocity-amp=5
&lt;/CsOptions&gt;
</code></pre>

Csound will open any available MIDI device. Every time a note is pressed, the note's frequency will
be passed to p4, while the note's amplitude will be passed to p5. The previous i-statements used to
trigger the instrument can now be removed from the score section. Below is the code for a fully
functioning MIDI synth. A second, slightly out of tune vco2 has been added to provide a little
warmth to the overall sound.

<pre><code data-language="csound">
&lt;CsoundSynthesizer&gt;
&lt;CsOptions&gt;
-odac -Ma --midi-key-cps=4 --midi-velocity-amp=5
&lt;/CsOptions&gt;
&lt;CsInstruments&gt;

instr 1
iFreq = p4
iAmp = p5
iAtt = 0.1
iDec = 0.4
iSus = 0.6
iRel = 0.7
iCutoff = 5000
iRes = .4
kEnv madsr iAtt, iDec, iSus, iRel 
aVco1 vco2 iAmp, iFreq
aVco2 vco2 iAmp, iFreq*.99
aLp moogladder (aVco1+aVco2)/2, iCutoff*kEnv, iRes
out aLp*kEnv
endin

&lt;/CsInstruments&gt;
&lt;CsScore&gt;

&lt;/CsScore&gt;
&lt;/CsoundSynthesizer&gt;
</code></pre>

Note that most frontends offer their own MIDI handling. Once this is set up, the user can omit
the *-Ma* option.


## Your first effect

Two things are required in order to create an audio effect in Csound. First, audio must be sent from
the analogue digital converter to Csound, and second, that audio needs to be accessed within an
instrument block. Csound can be instructed to open the ADC using the **-iadc** command line option
in the &lt;CsOptions&gt; section of the source code.

<pre><code data-language="csound">
&lt;CsOptions&gt;
-odac -iadc
&lt;/CsOptions&gt;
</code></pre>

The **inch** opcode can be used to access audio from the computer's sound card. It takes a single
input argument which specifies the audio channel. Once the audio signal has been accessed, it can be
passed through any number of opcodes that accept audio inputs. The **comb** filter opcode can be
used to create a simple echo type effect. It takes 3 input arguments.

<pre><code data-language="csound">
ares comb asig, krvt, ilpt
</code></pre>

**asig** will be an audio signal, while **krvt** sets the reverberation time in seconds. **ilpt** sets
the loop time of each echo. Note that the loop time should always be less than the reverberation
time, otherwise you will not hear any effect. In the next code example a simple stereo echo effect
is created by setting up two comb filters with different loop times and sending them to the left and
right output channels.

<pre><code data-language="csound">
&lt;CsoundSynthesizer&gt;
&lt;CsOptions&gt;
-odac -iadc
&lt;/CsOptions&gt;
&lt;CsInstruments&gt;

instr 1
aInL inch 1
aInR inch 2
aCombL comb aInL, 3, .5
aCombR comb aInR, 3, .7
out aCombL, aCombR
endin

&lt;/CsInstruments&gt;
&lt;CsScore&gt;
i1 0 1000
&lt;/CsScore&gt;
&lt;/CsoundSynthesizer&gt; 
</code></pre>

## Writing sounds to disk

There may be times when you will want to record the sounds your instrument's make in realtime. The
easiest way to do this is using a combination of the **fout** and **monitor**. **fout** allows one
to write an audio vector to file, while **monitor** grabs the contents of Csound's audio outut
buffer. Every sound that Csound produces is passed to its output buffer, so it's the go-to place
when we need to record audio output. Presented below is a simple instrument that will record all
sounds to a file called "fout_all.wav"

<pre><code data-language="csound">
instr 100;read the stereo csound output buffer and write to disk
allL, allR monitor
;write the output of csound to
;to a wav file: 16 bits with header
fout "fout_all.wav", 14, allL, allR
endin
</code></pre>

Instruments responsible for recording output should be on for the duration of a performance. Also
note that each time this instrument runs, it will overwrite the previous sound file. To avoid this,
users should move the output soundfile between each run, rename the file in your Csound code before
each run, or automatically construct a new file on each run using the system date and **sprintf**
opcodes.

## Common Errors

Csound will inform you of any errors contained in your source file. Understanding syntax errors is
key to making the most out of Csound. The most common error is the 'used before defined' error. This
occurs whenever a variable is accessed before it has been defined. For instance, in the following
code kAmp is passed as an input argument to **oscili** before it is declared.

<pre><code data-language="csound">
&lt;CsInstruments&gt;

instr 1
a1 oscili kAmp, 440
out a1
endin

&lt;/CsInstruments&gt; 
</code></pre>

When Csound reads through this code and gets to the line with **oscili** it gets confused because it
can't find a value for kAmp because it has not been defined. In order to avoid this error we have to
insure that all variables are defined before use.

<pre><code data-language="csound">
&lt;CsInstruments&gt;

instr 1
kAmp = 1
a1 oscili kAmp, 440
out a1
endin

&lt;/CsInstruments&gt; 
</code></pre>

Another common error is 'unexpected T_IDENT'. The most common reason for this error is a typo. The
typo can be caused by calling an opcode by an incorrect name, or from spelling an opcode with
capital letters. Remember that Csound is case sensitive; oscil is not the same as Oscil!

## Where to now?

There are lots of great resources available to those wishing to learn more about Csound. The [Csound
FLOSS Manual](http://write.flossmanuals.net/csound/preface/) is a comprehensive online textbook for
learning and using Csound. It covers all aspects of the language and provides detailed code examples
for you to follow.

The official [Csound Reference Manual](docs/manual/index.html) is available online as well as
included with most Csound editors and frontends. It contains all information about the usage of the
1500+ opcodes and includes an example of each one in use. That's more than 1500 Csound instruments
ready to play straight away!

There are also a number of excellent printed books available through a variety of different
publishers. You can check out the [Books](/books.html) section to find more information.
